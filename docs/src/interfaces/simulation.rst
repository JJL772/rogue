Simulation Interface
====================

Rogue provides a mechanism for interfacing to a synopsys vcs simulation in 
the same way it can interface with real hardware. This is made possible by using
the memory and stream interface bridge modules. A compiled VCS library contains
the server side of this bridge link.
