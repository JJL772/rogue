# Getting Rogue

There are three possible ways to obtain rogue. The recommended way is to install rogue as a pre-built anaconda package in an anaconda environment:

[a relative link](README_anaconda.md)


Alternatively you can download and build your own copy of rogue within an anaconda environment. This is usefull if you may want to contribute to the rogue development.

[a relative link](README_anaconda_build.md)

You may choose to build and run rogue outside of the anaconda environment. Instructions for doing so can be found here:

[a relative link](README_build.md)

If you need to install rogue behind a firewall you can use the following instructions:
